// VARIABLE IN JAVASCRIPT
// A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence.

// DECLARATION OF VARIABLE
// To use a variable, you've first got to create it â€” more accurately, we call this declaring the variable.
var fullName;
var age;
var country;

// INITIALIZATION OF VARIABLE
// Once you've declared a variable, you can initialize it with a value. You do this by typing the variable name, followed by an equals sign (=), followed by the value you want to give it. 
fullName = "Ikram Ullah Khan";
age = "20";
country = "Pakistan";

// PRINT ON CONSOLE
// If you want to print the above data on console you can do it through console.log()
console.log(fullName, age, country)
